I am a fourth year PhD student in the CS Theory Group at Northwestern University, advised by [Miklós Z. Rácz](https://racz.statistics.northwestern.edu/index.html). Prior to this, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Statistics from Renmin University of China in 2022. 

My main research interest lies in the intersection of Statistics and Computer Science. The common goals in my recent and ongoing works are working towards the establishment of statistical-computational gaps, developing efficient algorithms or testing procedure to solve estimation or detection problems, etc. I mostly work on various topics related to random networks, including but not limited to: beyond worst case analysis for NP-hard problems, dynamic evolving networks that mimic real-world phenomena, and dynamic process on the network.

In my spare time, I play golf and go to a lot of classical concerts.
