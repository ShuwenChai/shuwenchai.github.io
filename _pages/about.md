I am a second year PhD student at Northwestern Computer Science, advised by [Miklós Rácz](https://racz.statistics.northwestern.edu/index.html). Prior to this, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Statistics from Renin University of China in 2022. 

I have a broad interest across Random Graph and Reliable Machine Learning. I am currently studying efficient algorithms for graph matching and community recovery for stochastic block models. Besides, I am also aware of the importance of learning with untrusted or low-quality data.

In my spare time, I go to a lot of classical concerts and art museums.
