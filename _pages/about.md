I am a second year PhD student in the CS Theory Group at Northwestern University, advised by [Miklós Z. Rácz](https://racz.statistics.northwestern.edu/index.html). Prior to this, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Statistics from Renin University of China in 2022. 

I have a broad interest across Random Graph and Reliable Machine Learning. I am currently working on efficient algorithms for graph matching and community recovery on Correlated Stochastic Block Models. Besides, I am also interested in establishing theoretical guarantees for various topics under reliable machine learning, such that adversarial robustness and distribution shift.

In my spare time, I go to a lot of classical concerts and art museums. One of my favorite composers is Tchaikovsky (whose name has my family name as a substring) and my favorite modern pianter is Georgia O'Keeffe.
