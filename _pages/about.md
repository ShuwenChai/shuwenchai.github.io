I am a third year PhD student in the CS Theory Group at Northwestern University, advised by [Miklós Z. Rácz](https://racz.statistics.northwestern.edu/index.html). Prior to this, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Statistics from Remin University of China in 2022. 

I have a broad interest across statistical inference and algorithms on random graphs, statistical-computational gaps, and reliable machine learning. I am currently working on community detection and graph matching on various random graphs with planted community structures, and also testing problems considering community structures from a stochastic block model versus a gaussian mixture. Besides, I am also interested in establishing theoretical guarantees for various topics such as adversarial robustness and distribution shift.

In my spare time, I go to a lot of classical concerts. One of my favorite composers is Tchaikovsky (whose name has my family name as a substring).
